# About

> TL; DR: Mutation testing introduces changes to your code, then runs your unit tests against the changed code. It is expected that your unit tests will now fail. If they don't fail, it might indicate your tests do not sufficiently cover the code.

Demonstrates the benefits of mutation testing in identifying gaps in code coverage, remediating code smells, and improving the quality of testing strategies.
